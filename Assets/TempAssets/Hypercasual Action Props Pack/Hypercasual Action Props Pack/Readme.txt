2021, Helix Studio Assets© 
==========================

Thanks for your purchase(s)! :)

All models are set in the prefabs. You will find them in the "Prefabs" folder.
Prefabs are distributed in subfolders according to the shader used. In the package you will find prefabs with paid shader “Stylized Toony Shader” as an example. You can read more about this shaders at the link:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/stylized-toony-shader-161170

Each model is represented by two prefabs (Standard Unity Shader and paid Stylized Toony Shader) with different shaders as an example.
All you need to do is to add the prefab to the scene.

It is especially worth paying attention to some models:
Revolver-type grenade launchers have a rotating drum, but all the shells are combined together with it in one mesh.
A chain of joints has been created for the slingshot prefab, which can pull the elastic band (there is no animation for this action, this will have to be implemented using your scripts). The control node for stretching the elastic band is called "cc_Rubber".

The following shader packages were used for promo materials:
